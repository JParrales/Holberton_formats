# Holberton_formats

This Repository contains formats to create files in:

1. C -> Functions
2. C -> Header
3. Python
4. Bash

To use, clone the repository and copy the formats in the folders where you want
to create files using the "cp" command.

example:
cp /Holberton_formats/Python_format /holbertonschool-higher_level_programming0x00-python-hello_world/

To rename the format just use the "mv" command with the new name as second
argument:

example:
mv Function_format.c count_to_10.c

Let me know any questions o suggestions.
